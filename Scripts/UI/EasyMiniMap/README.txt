Thank you for installing EASY MINI MAP for Unity!

How to use:
1.) Add MiniMapManager prefab to your scene
2.) Provide a follow transform for the minimap to follow (if needed)
3.) Adjust all that you need in the EasyMiniMapManager component

Point of interest (POI)
1.) Attach EasyMiniMapPOI to the gameObject you want to be a POI
2.) Provide a sprite to be displayed on the minimap
3.) Tweak anything you may need using the transform/spriteRenderer component 
	Sidenote: For 3D games you may need to rotate your POI to face the minimap camera

It's that easy! Thanks again!
